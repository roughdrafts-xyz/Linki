- tags definitely need to be separate from groups
- need a way to title articles too
- wonder if theres a way to nonce an article? Probably not necessary content id already exists and titling will too soon. We can probably search by content or something if necessary. "find articles with similar content to this"
  - by groups
  - by tags
  - by content
