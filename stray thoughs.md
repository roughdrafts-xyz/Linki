- Should probably have a cache folder that holds compiled versions of files, or offer REDIS integration for that or something - Just in case someone accesses a version of a file a lot without putting it in the wiki.

- Can probably use cherrypy for the web server. Looks like it'll cost about 2.5Mb?
- marko or python-markdown might be good for the web server's markdown interpreter?
